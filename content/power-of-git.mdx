Did you know that 98% of the project the git is involved?

When I work as desktop support as my first job. I will make a time to learn with the developers in our department.
My interest and willing to get back in programming made me curious of how they solve a certain problems.
It's cool and a great responsibility at the same time, as I saw the terminal they type in the commandline.
I understand that I should be flexible using tools.

And the one thing should I learn is [git](https://git-scm.com/).

### Git Workflow: One-time Setup

```
  git clone https://github.com/repository-guide.git
  cd repo
  git remove -v  # View remotes
```

If you're contributing in an Open-Source.

```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository.git
  cd repo
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository.git
```

**Daily Start**

```
  # Team project
  git pull origin main

  # Open-Source
  git fetch upstream
  git checkout main
  git merge upstream/main
```

**Create a Feature or BugFix Branch**

```
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-branch
```

> feature/ - for new features

> fix/ - for bug fixes

> hotfix/ - for critical fixes

**Code & Track Changes**

```
  git status  # Check status, changes, and untracked files
  git add .   # Stage all changes
  git commit -m "Your commit message"  # Commit changes with a message

```

NOTE: Commit messages should be clear
Use Imperative: "Add login feature"
Reference Issue Numbers: Fix #001: Handle empty states.

**Push Branches**

```
  git push origin feature/your-feature-repo
```

Create a Pull Request

1. Go to GitHub
2. Open a Pull Request from your branch to main or develop
3. Add a Description, Screenshots and linked issues.

**Merge**

```
  git checkout main
  git pull origin main
  git merge feature/your-feature-name
  git push origin main

```

Optionally, you can delete the branch after merge.

Why?

This is the [reason](https://medium.com/@pipulpant/why-you-should-delete-merged-branches-in-git-c04f3f5d5948).

```
  git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
  git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name

```

**Cleanup**

```
  git fetch -p    # Remove deleted branches from remote
  git branch -a   # List all branches
```

**Undo or Roll Back (Safe Tools)**

```
  git log         # View Commit History
  git checkout   # View code from older commit
  git revert      # Undo with a new commit
```

**Tip:**

1. Use .gitignore to avoid committing unwanted files.
2. Make Atomic Commits: One logical change per commit.
3. Pull before pushing to avoid conflicts.
4. Resolve conflicts carefully, then git add and git commit

If ever I wanted to practice and check my git expertise.

I play this [git website](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) as my refresher
