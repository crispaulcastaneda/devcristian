When I start to contribute in an Open-Source. It helped me to understand the different types of projects. Whether it's a library, plugins, API, and now a large project that involves the important context and give fellow Filipino a transparency reports of the Philippine Government.

### What's the purpose of the Project?

The volunteer run portal of the Republic of the Philippines. Find information, access government services, stay updated with the latest news about the Philippines.


### Contributions

The web application is already built by the great devs and was shared to the group on social media. Introductions and the idea of the project was being written to the description.

There are many ways to contribute:

1. __GitHub repository__ - where you can fork the project and start reading documentations.
2. __Discord__ - A hangout for the engineers, developers, analyst, QA and more.
3. __Email__ - there's an active email from GitHub that you can reach if you really want to work primarily to the project.


### Is there any pay for my contributions?

No. This is a voluntarily or personal interest to join in the group. As I care to my Country and use my Technical skills to build a large project. I am willing to give time to offer something new at the same time I gain by knowing the other Developers capabilities, network, socialize, and also I could teach to the new devs in the industry.
