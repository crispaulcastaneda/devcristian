I followed the hands-on tutorial in the Readme of the first contributions and made my first pull request to the same repo.

What a great start to my open-source journey!

I’m excited to finally contribute to open-source projects, whether it’s writing documentation, refactoring code, or solving issues.
It feels rewarding to be part of something bigger and help drive innovation in even the smallest way.

Right now, I’m focused on understanding how open-source collaboration flows, especially how to avoid conflicts and align smoothly with project authors.

Another goal unlocked, and many more to come!
