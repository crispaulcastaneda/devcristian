As I enter the new era of development. CI/CD is a must-have for modern engineers. It improves code quality and saves time. Starting a simple, automate things, and expand.

# What is CI/CD?

**CI/CD** stands for

- CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically test the code when changes are deployed.
- CD (Continuous Development/Delivery): Automatically build and deploy the app for testing.

## Tools can be use

- GitHub - hosting repo and run Actions
- VS code - to write code and create workflow files.
- Git - to track changes and push to GitHub.
- Vercel - This is already integrating with Git repositories.

## Step-by-Step

My step-by-step guide when I am making a new repository and personal projects.

1. Create a GitHub repository
   - Click **new** -> Name of the repo -> Add **README.md**
   - Clone the repository:
   ```
       git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
       cd repository
   ```

## Setup the project

I can use any project - for example, a PHP or node.js app. Here's an example using PHP.

This is a manual setup

1. Inside my repo, I create:
   ```
   touch index.php composer.json
   ```
2. I add a simple PHP file and install dependencies if needed.

This is a setup from GitHub Actions

1. Inside the repository, click the _Actions_ tab
2. Search workflow. For example: PHP
3. Tap / Click **Configure**
4. Wait for the workflow finish the deployment.
5. Once the workflow deployed. Pull the updates from your local. Run the terminal and type:
   ```
       composer init
   ```
6. It will add new compose description. Fill the questions.

## Create the GitHub Action Workflow

For Manual set up post. Inside the project, create the directory and file:

```
 mkdir -p .github/workflows
 touch .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

```
name: PHP CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up PHP
        uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
        with:
          php-version: '8.1'

      - name: Validate composer.json and composer.lock
        run: composer validate

      - name: Run tests (if any)
        run: phpunit

```

> You can modify this workflow for JS, Python, etc.

## Commit and Push to GitHub

In VS Code Terminal

```
 git add.
 git commit -m "Description here"
 git push origin main
```

Once the changes deployed to the repository, go to your **GitHub Repo -> Actions Tab** check the workflow running.

## Optional: Add a simple test.

If your app has tests. GitHub actions will run automatically. Just make sure your app builds successfully.

### Final Notice

If you successfully work with the CI/CD Actions. The next steps you can try is

- Add testing
- Set up deployment (CD)
- Use secrets for environment variables.
